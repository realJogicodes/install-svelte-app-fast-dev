Design Specs for the installation script 
* check if dependencies are installed
  - operating system supported?
  - git?
  - node?
  - unzip?
* ask for the name of the project
* asks for folder to install the project in
  ? default folder: subfolder of current directory
  ? ask user if that folder is fine
  ? if not, ask for a new folder to use
* git clone the repository into the chosen folder with the project name under subfolder frontend
* get pocketbase
  ? get appropriate user system architecture for pocketbase download
  ? ask user if supported version or bleeding edge (latest)
  ? needs to be in appropriate sub-folder /pocketbase
  ? unzip it (ensure unzip is available on CLI)
  ? how would we handle this if not installed? install it?
* clone the repository and install svelte-app-fast
* navigate to appropriate folder
* install dependencies 
  ? npm install
